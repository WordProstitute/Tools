A collection of PERL scripts for copy-editing and publishing words. The copy-editing files and the publishing files worked during some point of time.
<br />
<br />
The script printbook.pl in the pl directory was used to publish Portland with Portland files in the conf folder, and it created a book for the U.S. Intranet, Amazon, iTunes and Barnes & Noble. The script may require executables no longer used by Amazon or Barnes & Noble. This is the output of the script:

<br />
The other PERL scripts were either quick utilities to serve an immediate need or the beginning of something brilliant that became bullshit. Or they're just shitty scripts that served a quick fix, but now linger in the limbo of pointlessness.
<br />
<br />
Please feel free to use, hack or rewrite and call the scripts your own. And please remember these are PERL scripts.

<a href="http://wordprostitute.com">Word Prostitute&reg;</a> left these scripts behind, so it can forget the scripts and begin to rewrite the processes with Java using objects and patterns to edit and publish words.

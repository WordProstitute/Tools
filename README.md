A collection of PERL scripts for copy-editing and publishing words. The copy-editing files and the publishing files worked during some point of time.
<br />
<br />
The script printbook.pl in the pl directory was used to publish Portland with Portland files in the conf folder, and it created a book for the U.S. Intranet, Amazon, iTunes and Barnes & Noble. The script may require executables no longer used by Amazon or Barnes & Noble. This is the output of the script:

<br />
<br />
The other PERL scripts were either quick utilities to serve an immediate need or the beginning of something brilliant that became bullshit. Or they're just shitty scripts that served a quick fix, but now linger in the limbo of pointlessness.
<br />
<br />
Please feel free to use, hack or rewrite and call the scripts your own. And please remember these are PERL scripts. 
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://wordprostitute.com">Word Prostitute&reg;</a> left these scripts behind, so it can forget the scripts and begin to rewrite the processes with Java using objects and patterns to edit and publish words.

<h2>System of Record for Fiction</h2>
<br />
<br />
PURPOSE:
<br />
The purpose of this document is to introduce the idea and present one of many ways to create a system of record for a fiction story.
<br />
<br />
REQUIREMENTS:
<br />
If you don't understand a term or tool then you can copy text verbatim from this file and enter it into a search and return engine like Google or Bing for more definition.
<br />
<br />
sorff.sh, the script that creates the system of record, requires a Bash Unix shell that's available on Ubuntu, MacOS X or Cygwin (for Windows), so sorff.sh can execute.
<br />
<br />
DEFINITIONS:
<br />
A system of record is a term used by data scientists to label a data collection's authoritative source.
<br />
<br />
A system of record's purpose for a fiction story is to provide a universal location for a writer or writers or editors to write and edit a story's text and binary files.
<br />
<br />
A system of record for a fiction story can be as simple as a text document saved on some operating system in some server in a warehouse across an ocean, or it could be a file directory filled with files on your thumb-sized hard drive, or it could a source controlled centralized Git repository.
<br />
<br />
The system of record for this story is a Git repository within a computer operating system using the following Tools to auto create a system of record for fiction for you.

Its ParagraphState is too simple and errors DialogState. PunctuationState's regexes are nascent and need to mature and grow because they're not casting the right pose. These errors and other errors inspire Word Prostitute&reg; to release this model to the world while Word Prostitute&reg; edits the model for deep learning machines, so they can edit and write.
<br />
<br />
This will also make Word Prostitute&reg; paranoid and drive it to edit and write the model to be the one that automates editing.

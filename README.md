perl = A collection of configuration files for copy-editing and publishing words. The copy-editing files and the publishing files worked during some point during time. And the publishing processes may required executables no longer used by Amazon or Apple or Barnes & Noble.

The script printbook.pl in the pl directory was used to publish Portland with Portland files in the conf folder.

Please feel free to use. And please remember these are PERL scripts. 

Word Prostitute(R) left these scripts behind to begin to rewrite the processes with Java using objects and patterns to edit and publish words.

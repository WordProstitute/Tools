perl = A collection of configuration files for copy-editing and pubishing words. The copy-editing files and the publishing files worked during some point during time. And the publishing processes may required executables no longer used by Amanzon or Apple or Barnes & Noble.

The script printbook.pl in the pl directory was used to publish Portland with Protland files in the conf folder.
